ACT ONE - Scene 1

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is dimly lit, filled with the gentle hum of city noise filtering through the window. ANNA, mid-20s, is sitting on her couch, eyes closed, a look of intense concentration on her face.

ANNA
(whispering to herself)
Breathe in, breathe out. You're okay, Anna. You're okay.

Suddenly, a wave of emotion hits her. She GRASPS her chest, as if in pain.

There's a knock at the door. Anna opens her eyes, startled.

JAMES
(through the door)
Anna? You in there? I could hear you all the way down the hall.

Anna gets up, takes a moment to compose herself, then opens the door.

ANNA
(forcing a smile)
Hi, James. Sorry, I was just... meditating.

James, late 20s, smiles back at her, concern in his eyes. He can tell she's not being completely honest, but he doesn't push it.

JAMES
Well, don't let me interrupt your Zen time. Just wanted to drop off your mail. You got a letter from that psychologist you've been seeing, Dr. Caldwell.

Anna's eyes widen as she accepts the letter, her heart racing.

Scene 2: INT. DR. CALDWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Caldwell sits behind her desk, a well-organized space filled with shelves of psychology books and various awards. She looks at an old photograph of her family, her face showing a mix of sadness and anger.

DR. CALDWELL
(whispers)
I tried so hard to save you.

A flashback begins, showing Dr. Caldwell's life before she became a therapist.

FLASHBACK: INT. DR. CALDWELL'S HOME - NIGHT

A younger Dr. Caldwell is at home with her husband, JOHN, and her daughter, EMMA. They are a loving family, but it's clear that Emma is struggling emotionally.

EMMA
(crying)
Mom, I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't control my feelings. It's like they're taking over...

BACK TO PRESENT: INT. DR. CALDWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Caldwell is snapped out of her flashback by a knock on the door. She quickly wipes a tear from her eye, hides the photograph, and composes herself.

DR. CALDWELL
(firmly)
Come in.

The door opens, and ANNA enters. She looks nervous, but there's a determination in her eyes.

ANNA
(nervous)
I'm ready. I need to know what's happening to me.

Dr. Caldwell nods, opening a leather-bound notebook and preparing to take notes. This is the beginning of their sessions.

DR. CALDWELL
Let's start with your childhood. Can you tell me about any significant events or traumas that might have triggered your abilities?

Anna hesitates, thinking back to her difficult past. As Anna starts to trust Dr. Caldwell more, Anna becomes more confident and determined to uncover the dangerous conspiracy Dr. Caldwell is orchestrating

Scene 3:
INT. DR. CALDWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Anna enters Dr. Caldwell's office, a space filled with an air of professionalism and calm. It's comfortably furnished, with shelves laden with psychology books and tasteful artwork adorning the walls. Dr. Caldwell, a seemingly empathetic and experienced psychologist, welcomes Anna and encourages her to take a seat.

DR. CALDWELL (smiling)
"Welcome, Anna. I'm glad you decided to come. In order to help you manage your abilities, we'll need to understand their origin and the emotions that trigger them."

Anna sits, her body language reflecting her nervousness. She takes a deep breath, bracing herself to delve into her past.

ANNA (nervous)
"I'm ready. I need to understand what's happening to me."

As they begin their session, Dr. Caldwell subtly manipulates Anna's emotions, making her more comfortable and willing to open up. This manipulation is a careful exercise of power, with Dr. Caldwell's true intentions hidden behind her professional demeanor.
