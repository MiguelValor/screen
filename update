ACT ONE - Scene 1

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is dimly lit, filled with the gentle hum of city noise filtering through the window. ANNA, mid-20s, is sitting on her couch, eyes closed, a look of intense concentration on her face.

ANNA
(whispering to herself)
Breathe in, breathe out. You're okay, Anna. You're okay.

Suddenly, a wave of emotion hits her. She GRASPS her chest, as if in pain.

There's a knock at the door. Anna opens her eyes, startled.

JAMES
(through the door)
Anna? You in there? I could hear you all the way down the hall.

Anna gets up, takes a moment to compose herself, then opens the door.

ANNA
(forcing a smile)
Hi, James. Sorry, I was just... meditating.

James, late 20s, smiles back at her, concern in his eyes. He can tell she's not being completely honest, but he doesn't push it.

JAMES
Well, don't let me interrupt your Zen time. Just wanted to drop off your mail. You got a letter from that psychologist you've been seeing, Dr. Caldwell.

Anna's eyes widen as she accepts the letter, her heart racing.
