ACT ONE
INT. ANNA'S NIGHTMARE - NIGHT
A dark, twisted version of Anna's apartment. Everything is distorted and unsettling. Shadows creep along the walls as if they have a life of their own.
Anna (28, introverted, talente APARTMENT d artist) stands in the center of the room, surrounded by faceless figures that seem to be silently screaming. She feels their emotions - pain, fear, and anger - flooding into her, overwhelming her senses.
Suddenly, Anna jolts awake.

INT. ANNA'S - NIGHT
Anna, frightened and confused, sits up in her small, cluttered apartment filled with art supplies and unfinished paintings.
ANNA
(whispers)
What's happening to me?
Anna looks around, trying to make sense of her nightmare. She notices one of her unfinished paintings has changed, now a darker and more chaotic image.

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY
Anna, now dressed and still shaken, sits at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee. Her sister, LILY (32, successful artist, warm and nurturing), enters, concerned.
LILY
You look exhausted. Did you sleep at all?
ANNA
(faking a smile)
Just another nightmare.
Lily frowns, worried about her sister.
LILY
Well, don't forget about my art exhibition tonight. It'll be a nice distraction for you.
ANNA
(pauses)
I appreciate it, Lily. I'll be there.
Lily hugs her sister and exits, leaving Anna to ponder her newfound ability and the impact it will have on her life.

EXT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
Anna approaches the gallery, her face betraying her internal struggle. She takes a deep breath and enters the bustling event, unsure of what the future holds.

INT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
The gallery is filled with guests admiring various art pieces, discussing them with enthusiasm. Anna, wearing sunglasses and a hat, tries her best to avoid any emotional connections with the guests. She meets up with Lily, who is excited to show her the latest piece.
LILY
(leading Anna to her paintings)
Come on, I want to show you my latest piece.
Anna follows, her eyes darting around the room, hoping to avoid any emotional connections with the guests.
They arrive at Lily's painting, a stunning landscape filled with vivid colors and intricate details.
LILY
(smiling proudly)
What do you think?
Anna admires the painting, genuinely impressed.
ANNA
It's amazing, Lily. You've outdone yourself.
LILY
Thank you, Anna. That means a lot coming from you.
Lily introduces Anna to a few guests, and they exchange small talk. Anna is visibly uncomfortable, still trying to avoid any emotional connections.

INT. SMALL ART GALLERY - LATER
Anna decides to step outside for a moment to clear her head. As she walks past a painting, she notices a man, JAMES (28, fellow artist, Anna's best friend), deeply studying the piece.
ANNA
(smiling)
I didn't know you'd be here, James.
JAMES
(surprised)
Anna! I wouldn't miss Lily's exhibition. How are you holding up?
ANNA
(sighs)
I'm trying, but it's not easy.
James nods in understanding, knowing about Anna's struggle.

EXT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
Anna and James stand outside the gallery, breathing in the cool night air.
JAMES
You know, I've been doing some research on people who experience what you're going through. It seems like you're not alone.
Anna listens intently, hopeful for answers.
JAMES(CONT'D)
I found some online forums where people discuss their experiences. Some have even found ways to control or minimize their abilities.
ANNA
(reassured)
That's... that's really good to know. Thank you, James.
They share a smile before re-entering the gallery.

INT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
Lily spots Anna and James as they re-enter and approaches them, holding a glass of wine.
LILY
(grinning)
Anna, I have an idea. Why don't you paint something for the crowd?
ANNA
(embarrassed)
Oh, no, I couldn't. I'm not prepared.
LILY
(insistent)
Come on, it'll be fun! Everyone here would love to see your talent.
Feeling the pressure, Anna reluctantly agrees. She sets up her easel and canvas, taking a deep breath before starting to paint.
As Anna begins to create a beautiful, intricate piece, the crowd watches in admiration. However, the feeling of being judged makes her increasingly nervous and anxious. She begins to feel the emotions of everyone around her.
She is overwhelmed by negative emotions. She enters a trance, transported to a dark, nightmarish place, even more terrifying than before. The horrifying images and emotions surround her, consuming her mind.

INT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
Anna, trapped in her nightmare state, unknowingly transfers the disturbing images onto the canvas. The once-beautiful painting now depicts a haunting scene, with twisted faces and figures drowning in a sea of darkness.
The crowd watches in shock and confusion. Lily, sensing something is wrong, rushes to her sister's side.
LILY
(shouting)
Anna, snap out of it!
Lily's voice pierces through Anna's nightmare, and she suddenly snaps back to reality. Anna looks at the painting in horror, realizing what she's done.
ANNA
(panicked)
I-I didn't mean to...
The crowd murmurs, some with expressions of awe, while others look disturbed or frightened. Anna, overwhelmed by their emotions, backs away from the painting, trembling.
LILY
(protective)
Everybody, please give her some space.
Lily escorts Anna out of the gallery, leaving behind a room full of bewildered spectators.

EXT. SMALL ART GALLERY - NIGHT
Anna, leaning against the wall outside the gallery, gasps for air, trying to regain control. Lily watches her with concern.
LILY
Anna, what happened in there?
ANNA
(tearfully)
I don't know, Lily. I can't control it. I feel everyone's emotions, and it's tearing me apart.
Lily pulls Anna into a comforting embrace.
LILY
We'll figure this out, okay? You're not alone in this.
Anna nods, grateful for her sister's support, but unsure of how to overcome her newfound curse.

LILY
(fascinated)
These symbols have been found in ruins all over the world. There must be a reason they're connected to emotional healing.
JAMES

(curious)
But what do they have to do with me? Why were they sent to me?

(protective)
It could be a trap, Anna. I don't want you to get hurt.

This must be the place.
LILY
(whispers)
This is giving me the creeps. Let's just grab the drawing and get out of here.
JAMES
(agrees)
We need to be careful. There's no telling what kind of security measures are in place.

(startled)
Who are you? What do you want with me?
DR. CALDWELL
(smiling)
My name is Dr. Caldwell, and I am the one who sent you those drawings. You see, I've been watching you, Anna. I know all about your abilities, and I believe we can help each other.
LILY
(suspicious)
Help each other? How?
DR. CALDWELL
I am a scientist, specializing in the study of psychic and supernatural phenomena. I've been trying to unlock the secrets of your abilities, Anna, and I believe the drawings are the key.
JAMES
(angry)
You've been spying on her? That's a violation of her privacy!
DR. CALDWELL
(slyly)
Sometimes, the ends justify the means, young man. And in this case, the end is the betterment of humankind.
ANNA
(confused)
What do you mean?
DR. CALDWELL
Your abilities, Anna, have the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and treat emotional trauma. With your help, we can harness that power and improve the lives of millions.
ANNA
(hesitant)
I... I don't know.
JAMES
(defiant)
You can't trust her, Anna. She's been manipulating you from the start.
Dr. Caldwell takes a step forward, her eyes locked on Anna.
DR. CALDWELL
I understand your hesitation, but I assure you, my intentions are pure. Let me show you what I've discovered about your abilities and the drawings.
Anna, torn between her desire for answers and her friends' warnings, hesitates for a moment before finally nodding in agreement. Dr. Caldwell leads them deeper into the warehouse, where she reveals her extensive research on Anna's abilities and the ancient symbols. 

INT. DR. CALDWELL'S LAB - NIGHT
Dr. Caldwell leads Anna, James, and Lily into her hidden laboratory, filled with advanced equipment and shelves lined with books on the paranormal. In the center of the room, there is a large table with several of the drawings spread out on it.
DR. CALDWELL
(enthused)
As you can see, I've devoted my life to the study of the unexplained. But your abilities, Anna, are unlike anything I've ever encountered before.
ANNA
(curious)
What have you discovered about the drawings?
DR. CALDWELL
These drawings are ancient, dating back thousands of years. They depict a civilization that was built around individuals with abilities like yours, Anna. It appears that the people of this ancient society revered those with psychic powers and utilized their abilities to maintain peace and harmony.
LILY
(astonished)
That's incredible.
JAMES
(skeptical)
But why send the drawings to Anna?
DR. CALDWELL
I believe that these drawings can help unlock the full potential of Anna's abilities. By studying the symbols and rituals depicted in the drawings, we can enhance her powers and bring about a new age of understanding and healing for all mankind.
ANNA
(uncertain)
I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of responsibility.
DR. CALDWELL
(reassuring)
You don't have to decide right now, Anna. I just wanted you to know the truth and the potential you possess.
As they continue to discuss the drawings, an alarm suddenly blares, interrupting their conversation.
DR. CALDWELL
(concerned)
We have to leave, now!
JAMES
(confused)
What's going on?
DR. CALDWELL
I'm not the only one who's been searching for answers. There are others who would use your powers for their own nefarious purposes. We must protect you and the drawings at all costs.
The group quickly gathers the drawings and follows Dr. Caldwell as she leads them through a hidden exit. 

INT. SECRET TUNNEL - NIGHT
Dr. Caldwell leads Anna, James, and Lily through the dimly lit secret tunnel, filled with cobwebs and dusty relics. The sound of the alarm grows fainter as they venture deeper into the tunnel.
LILY
(whispers)
Do you think they're following us?
DR. CALDWELL
(nods)
I'm certain of it. We need to find a safe place to hide, regroup, and plan our next move.
JAMES
(worried)
But where can we go? If they've found your lab, they might know about us too.
DR. CALDWELL
I have a safe house not far from here. It's off the grid and well-hidden. We should be safe there, at least for now.

INT. HIDDEN TUNNEL - NIGHT
The group hurries through the dark, narrow tunnel, led by Dr. Caldwell. The sounds of footsteps echo behind them, indicating they're being pursued.
LILY
(breathing heavily)
Are we going to be okay?
DR. CALDWELL
(determined)
We just need to make it to the other side of the tunnel. There's a safe house where we can regroup.
As they continue to run, Anna suddenly stops, sensing something.
ANNA
(whispering)
Wait. They're getting closer. I can feel them.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
The group catches their breath and gathers their bearings in the moonlit forest. Dr. Caldwell leads them towards the safe house, hidden among the trees.
DR. CALDWELL
(relieved)
We made it. Let's get inside and regroup.

EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
They emerge from the tunnel into a secluded, wooded area. The safe house is a small cabin, nestled between the trees.
DR. CALDWELL
(relieved)
We made it.
They enter the safe house, where they can finally catch their breath and discuss their next steps.

END OF ACT ONE.

ACT TWO
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
Inside the cabin, the group gathers around a table, where Dr. Caldwell lays out the ancient drawings. They discuss their plans to protect Anna and unlock the true potential of her powers. Meanwhile, they must also stay one step ahead of the mysterious pursuers who want to exploit Anna's abilities for their own dark purposes.
As the group delves deeper into the history of the ancient civilization and the secrets hidden within the drawings, they uncover a complex web of deceit, betrayal, and ancient rivalries that have spanned centuries. They realize that they are not only fighting for Anna's safety, but for the fate of the world itself.
